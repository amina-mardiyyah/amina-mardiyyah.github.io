I earned an Master's in Machine Intelligence from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences/Machine Intelligence [AIMS/AMMI](www.aimsammi.org), fully funded by Facebook(Meta) and Google. I was one of 40 students chosen from over 7000 applicants from across Africa. I have wide range of experience working on projects involving text-classification, language modelling, and speech recognition systems.
I am currently working as research intern at [Idiap](https://idiap.ch/en) Research Institute in Martigny, Switzerland, supervised by [Phil Garner](https://pgarner.github.io/). In the past, I worked as a summer intern at the [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL](https://epfl.ch/en)) a public research university located in Lausanne, Switzerland.

**Research Interests**:
Interested in LLMs, Speech and audio processing, Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision, with applications to Clinical use-cases/Healthcare, Low-resource/resource-constrained environments

**Other Interesting things me**
In my spare time, i write articles, You can read my articles on [Medium](https://mardiyyah.medium.com). I also love participating in competitive hackathons. Find profile Here: [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/users/Mardiyyah)
