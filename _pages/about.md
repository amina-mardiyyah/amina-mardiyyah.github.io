I am an African researcher. I earned an African Master's in Machine Intelligence from the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences/Machine Intelligence [AIMS/AMMI](www.aimsammi.org), fully funded by Facebook(Meta) and Google. I was one of 40 students chosen from over 7000 applicants from across Africa. I have wide range of experience working on projects involving text-classification, language modelling, and speech recognition systems.
I am currently working as predoctoral research intern at [Idiap](https://idiap.ch/en) Research Institute in Martigny, Switzerland, supervised by Phil Garner. In the past, I worked as a summer intern at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://epfl.ch/en)) a public research university located in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
